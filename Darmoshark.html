              <p>
                Darmoshark, a gaming peripherals brand headquartered in China,
                specializes in delivering premium products tailored for the
                high-end gaming market. Renowned for innovation, Darmoshark
                pioneers gaming excellence with a diverse range of high-quality
                gaming products. From precision-engineered mice and immersive
                headsets to advanced gaming keyboards, each product is a
                testament to cutting-edge technology, perfect for gamers seeking
                an elevated gaming experience. This project centers on the
                creation of advertising designs for Darmoshark's flagship
                product, namely the Darmoshark M3 gaming mouse, including its 4k
                edition. This is an unofficial passion project that started out
                as a small design exercise but it slowly turned into a bigger
                and more complex creative exploration.

              <p>
                This project aimed to craft distinctive advertisement designs
                for the Darmoshark M3 mouse, aiming to convey a sense of
                sophistication, high-end, and premium quality. I identified a
                need for an elevated aesthetic in the existing designs of the
                company. Furthermore, my goal was to visually articulate the
                dual nature of the mouse - portraying it not only as a
                lightweight marvel but also as a powerful and precise gaming
                tool.

            <div class="Paragraph-one">
              <p>
                I encountered the challenge of establishing a consistent premium
                aesthetic across all advertisements. Following thoughtful
                consideration, I opted for an abstract tech style characterized
                by clean gradients, bold shapes, and tech overlays to
                effectively convey the desired visual aesthetic. My other
                challenge was executing the idea, which can be seen in the
                process.

            <div class="Paragraph-one">
              <p>
                Below are some sketches I created to brainstorm different
                compositions. I played around with unique shapes for the
                backgrounds, embracing a more unconventional approach. The
                drawings may seem random, but that's part of the creative
                brainstorming process. This experimentation helped me refine and
                move closer to my vision.

            <div class="Paragraph-one">
              <p>
                After the experimental sketching phase, I chose to bring the
                ideas to life in Photoshop. I utilized tools such as the pen and
                gradient tools and incorporated some technology-related stock
                photos. What you see here are the early, initial versions of the
                backgrounds that would later evolve into the final products seen
                above.
