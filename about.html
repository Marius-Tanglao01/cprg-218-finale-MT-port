          Arguing that Ken Carson is better than The Beatles is a subjective
          statement, but here are some possible reasons one might make that claim,
          depending on personal preference or context: 1. Modern Relevance Ken
          Carson represents the new wave of hip-hop, trap, and hyperpop,
          resonating with younger, Gen Z audiences. His sound reflects the current
          music landscape and the desires of modern listeners, while The Beatles’
          music is from a different era and may not feel as relevant to some
          today. 2. Experimental Production Ken Carson’s music incorporates modern
          trap beats, auto-tune, and futuristic production, appealing to fans of
          experimental sounds. His work with Playboi Carti and others in the
          underground rap scene shows a willingness to push boundaries in a
          digital age where genres blend and evolve quickly. 3. Cultural Impact on
          Today's Youth Ken Carson’s aesthetic, social media presence, and fashion
          influence are very in tune with the modern youth culture. For younger
          listeners, he is not just a musician but a cultural figure, especially
          in the underground hip-hop scene, where individuality and rebellion play
          huge roles. 4. Energetic Live Performances Ken Carson’s high-energy
          performances, including mosh pits and aggressive crowd participation,
          create an intense and electrifying atmosphere at shows. Some may find
          this more exciting than the more classic concert style of The Beatles.
          5. Instant Connection with Digital-Native Audiences Ken Carson’s success
          is fueled by platforms like SoundCloud, Instagram, and TikTok, where
          today's digital-native audience consumes music differently. His music
          spreads quickly through memes, online trends, and viral moments, giving
          him a dynamic digital reach that The Beatles couldn't leverage in their
          time.
